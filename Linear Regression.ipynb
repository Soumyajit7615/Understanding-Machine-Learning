    "The focus of supervised learning revolves around the input and output variables using an algorithm to predict the outcome. If a new input variable comes into the picture. The linear regression algorithm in machine learning is a supervised learning technique to approximate the mapping function to get the best predictions. In this article, we will learn about linear regression for machine learning. The following topics are discussed in this blog.\n",

    "## What is Regression?\n",
    "The main goal of regression is the construction of an efficient model to predict the dependent attributes from a bunch of attribute variables. A regression problem is when the output variable is either real or a continuous value i.e salary, weight, area, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also define regression as a statistical means that is used in applications like housing, investing, etc. It is used to predict the relationship between a dependent variable and a bunch of independent variables. Let us take a look at various types of regression techniques.\n",

    "## Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "One of the most interesting and common regression technique is simple linear regression. In this, we predict the outcome of a dependent variable based on the independent variables, the relationship between the variables is linear. Hence, the word linear regression.\n",

    "At this point, you need to consider a few important things about linear regression before applying it to the data. You could have studied this earlier in this tutorial, but studying these factors at this particular point of time will help you get the real feel.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Linear Assumption:</b> Linear regression is best employed to capture the relationship between the input variables and the outputs. In order to do so, linear regression assumes this relationship to be linear (which might not be the case all the time). But you can always transform your data so that a linear relationship is maintained. For example, if your data has an exponential relationship, you can apply log-transform to make the relationship linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Collinearity between the features:</b> Collinearity is a measure to calculate the importance of a feature of a dataset mathematically. When you have a dataset in which the features are very correlated to each other, linear regression fails to approximate the relationship appropriately and tends to overfit. So, it is efficient to detect the highly correlated features and to drop them before you apply linear regression. If you want to know more about this, feel free to check this excellent Kaggle kernel.\n",
    "Let's do some hands-on now. To keep things simple you will just take RM — the average number of rooms feature for now. Note that Statsmodels does not add a constant term (recall the factor θ0) by default. Let’s see it first without the constant term in your regression model:"
